We used the novel Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka, found on Project Gutenburg.  We used a Python script that iterated through the novel to create each text file (allwords.txt, uniquewords.txt, wordfrequency.txt)

a3_novelvisualization
	Displays a 700x600 pixel screen that shows a word cloud of unique words. We used Copperplate as the font, becaue it had a professional display. It matched the seriousness of the book chosen. We used a size 32-font to display the words legibly. For word color, we wanted the words' colors to be evenly distributed. To do this, we assigned colors based on the first letter of each word (e.g. a-h, i-q, r-z were assigned different colors). We chose three different dark colors to reflect the novel's plot. A new set of unique words can be generated by clicking the screen.
	
	
	
	
	
a3_wordfrequency
	Displays a logarithmic graph which shows a red dot at each point. A point corresponds to a word frequency and the number of words in the story metamorphosis that are used at exactly that frequency.
	The X and Y axes are labeled and marked according to their scales.
	This was interesting because we found a near-linear relationship once the frequencies and number of words were transformed to a log scale.
