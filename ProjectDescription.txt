a3_wordfrequency
	Displays a logarithmic graph which shows a red dot at each point. A point corresponds to a word frequency and the number of words in the story metamorphosis that are used at exactly that frequency.
	The X and Y axes are labeled and marked according to their scales.
	This was interesting because we found a near-linear relationship once the frequencies and number of words were transformed to a log scale.
