and
when
the
bearer
of
good
tidings
came
he
cast
it
on
his
face
and
jacobs
eyesight
returned
then
he
said
did
i
not
tell
you
that
i
knew
from
god
what
ye
knew
not
they
said
our
father
ask
pardon
for
our
crimes
for
us
for
we
have
indeed
been
sinners
he
said
i
will
ask
your
pardon
of
my
lord
for
he
is
gracious
merciful
and
when
they
came
into
joseph
he
took
his
parents
to
him
and
said
enter
ye
egypt
if
god
will
secure
and
he
raised
his
parents
to
the
seat
of
state
and
they
fell
down
bowing
themselves
unto
him
then
said
he
o
my
father
this
is
the
meaning
of
my
dream
of
old
my
lord
hath
now
made
it
true
and
he
hath
surely
been
gracious
to
me
since
he
took
me
forth
from
the
prison
and
hath
brought
you
up
out
of
the
desert
after
that
satan
had
stirred
up
strife
between
me
and
my
brethren
for
my
lord
is
gracious
to
whom
he
will
for
he
is
the
knowing
the
wise
o
my
lord
thou
hast
given
me
dominion
and
hast
taught
me
to
expound
dark
sayings
maker
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
my
guardian
art
thou
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
cause
thou
me
to
die
a
muslim
and
join
me
with
the
just
this
is
one
of
the
secret
histories
which
we
reveal
unto
thee
thou
wast
not
present
with
josephs
brethren
when
they
conceived
their
design
and
laid
their
plot
but
the
greater
part
of
men
though
thou
long
for
it
will
not
believe
thou
shalt
not
ask
of
them
any
recompense
for
this
message
it
is
simply
an
instruction
for
all
mankind
and
many
as
are
the
signs
in
the
heavens
and
on
the
earth
yet
they
will
pass
them
by
and
turn
aside
from
them
and
most
of
them
believe
not
in
god
without
also
joining
other
deities
with
him
what
are
they
sure
that
the
overwhelming
chastisement
of
god
shall
not
come
upon
them
or
that
that
hour
shall
not
come
upon
them
suddenly
while
they
are
unaware
say
this
is
my
way
resting
on
a
clear
proof
i
call
you
to
god
i
and
whoso
followeth
me
and
glory
be
to
god
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
add
other
deities
to
him
never
before
thee
have
we
sent
any
but
men
chosen
out
of
the
people
of
the
cities
to
whom
we
made
revelations
will
they
not
journey
through
the
land
and
see
what
hath
been
the
end
of
those
who
were
before
them
but
the
mansions
of
the
next
life
shall
be
better
for
those
who
fear
god
will
they
not
then
comprehend
when
at
last
the
apostles
lost
all
hope
and
deemed
that
they
were
reckoned
as
liars
our
aid
reached
them
and
we
delivered
whom
we
would
but
our
vengeance
was
not
averted
from
the
wicked
certainly
in
their
histories
is
an
example
for
men
of
understanding
this
is
no
new
tale
of
fiction
but
a
confirmation
of
previous
scriptures
and
an
explanation
of
all
things
and
guidance
and
mercy
to
those
who
believe
